These scripts can be used to save or open saved layouts in i3. I create shortcuts in my bin folder to point to everything, so I use as follows:

$ save WORKSPACE_NUMBER LAYOUT_NAME

$ open LAYOUT_NAME [WORKSPACE_NUMBER]

A shortcut to open a specific layout is created with the same name as the layout only if nothing in my PATH exists with that name. So, most of the time, I use by hitting mod+d to open dmenu and type the name of the layout I want.
